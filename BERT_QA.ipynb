    "passage= 'BERT, which is an acronym for Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformer, is a state of the art language model which can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. \\\n",
    " My objective is to introduce BERT at a high level, and enable you to create practical applications using BERT. You need to have basic knowledge of Python as well as a basic idea of machine learning. \\\n",
    "After going through this post, you should be able to use BERT for Binary or multiclass classification or Regression model or Question Answering Application. \\\n",
    "BERT brings the transfer learning paradigm into the natural language processing area. Transfer learning means a model developed for a task can be reused as a starting point for another task. \\\n",
    "BERT is trained on the entirety of Wikipedia text (~2.5 billion words) as well as a book corpus (800 million words). You don’t need to repeat this compute intensive process to make practical use of BERT.\\\n",
    "For specific tasks such as classification or question answering you just need to do incremental training on a much smaller dataset. This process is called fine tuning. This is like getting a person who is proficient in English and providing them extra guidance on how to identify positive sentiment vs negative sentiment from movie reviews.\\\n",
    "This is a quick introduction on the BERT pre-training process. For practical uses, you will get a BERT pretrained model and you do not need to perform this step. \\\n",
    "BERT takes 2 chunks of text, which may include multiple sentences, as inputs (shown in the diagram above). These 2 chunks are referred to as Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 in the diagram above.  Before feeding sentences to BERT, 15% of words are masked. Also, sentence 2 may not always be in continuation of sentence 1. \\\n",
    "BERT’s pre-training process is like teaching the English language to the BERT model so that it can be used for various tasks which need knowledge of English. This is accomplished by 2 practice tasks given to BERT: \\\n",
    "1) Predict masked (hidden) tokens: To illustrate, words “favorite” and “to” are masked in the diagram. BERT will try to predict these masked tokens as part of pre-training. This is similar to the “fill in the blanks” task we may give to a student learning English. While trying to fill the missing words, the student will learn the language. This is referred to as Masked Language Model (MLM) in the natural language processing area. \\\n",
    "2) Next sentence prediction: Along with the technique mentioned above, BERT tries to predict if sentence 2 comes right after sentence 1 or not. This provides deeper understanding on sentence dependencies. \\\n",
    "To use BERT for practical use, we need to fine-tune it for specific tasks. This process finetunes the pre-trained model so that it can perform specific tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering. In this process,BERT parameters get adjusted to do the specific task. '\n",
